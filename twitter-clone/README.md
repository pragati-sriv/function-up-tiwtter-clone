# Twitter Clone

Welcome to the Twitter Clone! This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of the popular social media platform, Twitter. Users can create an account, follow other users, post tweets, and interact with other users' tweets by liking and commenting on them.

## Getting Started

```

Once you have the project on your machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

The application will be hosted on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage

You can create a new account by clicking on the "Sign up" button on the homepage. Once you have created an account, you can log in and start using the platform.

From the dashboard, you can create new tweets, follow other users, and view your timeline to see the tweets posted by users you follow. You can also view your profile to see your own tweets, followers, and following.

Please note that this Twitter clone provides a basic platform for users to engage with each other in a similar way to the original Twitter. It is not intended for production use and is only meant for learning purposes.



If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to reach out.



Enjoy using the Twitter Clone!
